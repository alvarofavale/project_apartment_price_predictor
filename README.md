# APARTMENT PRICE PREDICTOR

Welcome to my Final Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the project: 'Apartment Price Predictor.' This project uses a dataset containing over 1.2 million entries from 2012 to 2023. Data from Idealista, the leading Spanish platform for renting and buying properties.
By employing machine learning, we have developed a algorithm to accurately predict selling prices based on specific features.
Let's dive in and discover the impact of data-driven predictions!

## Research question

Can we accurately predict apartment sale prices in a fluctuating market with rising costs?
Current Spanish Real Estate Market Overview.
The Spanish real estate market is currently characterized by strong demand and limited supply. This mismatch has driven up housing prices, particularly for new builds.
+40% price increasing in last 5 years
Therefore, a tool that quickly predicts property values is essential for saving time and assessing purchasing options.
Our application is user-friendly and provides the results you need in less than 5 minutes!


## Data Tools

There is a datasets that will guide your analysis:

1. idealista_output_etl: A dataset with over 1.2 million entries, providing information on prices for buying and selling apartments in Spain from 2012 to 2023. Each row contains details or features about the apartments, such as location, neighborhood, area, etc
2. idealista_field_description: field description for dataset idealista_output_etl



## Tools and Resources
